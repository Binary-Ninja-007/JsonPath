In The Pipe
===========
* Added EvaluationListener interface that allows abortion of evaluation if criteria is fulfilled.
  this makes it possible to limit the number of results to fetch when a document is scanned. Also 
  added utility method to limit results `JsonPath.parse(json).limit(1).read("$..title", List.class);`
* Added support for OR in inline filters [?(@.foo == 'bar' || @.foo == 'baz')]  


1.1.0 (2014-10-01)
==================
* Reintroduced method JsonProvider.createMap(). This should never have been removed. **NOTE: This is a breaking change if you implemented your own JsonProvider based on the 1.0.0 API**  
* Filters threw exception if an item being filtered did not contain the path being filtered upon.
* Multi-property selects works as it did in 0.9. e.g. `$[*]['category', 'price']` 
* Cache results when predicates refer to path in document e.g. `$[*][?(@.price <= $.max-price)]` will only evaluate `$.max-price` once.   

1.0.0 (2014-09-26)
==================
* Complete rewrite of internals. Major API changes.
* Better compliance with the Goessner implementation
